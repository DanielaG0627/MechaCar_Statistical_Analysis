## Linear Regression to Predict MPG


- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

In order; vehicle_length, ground_clearance and vehicle_weight are the coefficients with the greatest non-random variance

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Since the r-squared value is closer to 1, the slope of the model is not considered to be 0.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This model can effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes because multiple R-squared value is 0.71, and the p-value is 5.35e-11 which meets the 0.5 criteria.
